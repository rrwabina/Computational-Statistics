\frametitle{Multiplication by a Scalar}

Multiplication by a scalar involves multiplying each element
in the vector by the scalar:
\begin{equation*}
    b = \sigma a\ \ \ \Longleftrightarrow\ \ \  b_i = \sigma a_i\ \ \ i = 1,\ldots,n
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    a = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}

    b = \frac{a}{2} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3  \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\frametitle{Vector Transpose}

The \emph{transpose} of a row vector is a column vector:
\begin{equation*}
    u = \bigl[1, 2, 3\bigr]
    \qquad
    \text{then}
    \qquad
    u^T = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Likewise if $v$ is the column vector
\begin{equation*}
    v = \begin{bmatrix}4 \\ 5 \\ 6\end{bmatrix}
    \qquad
    \text{then}
    \qquad
    v^T = \bigl[4, 5, 6\bigr]

\frametitle{Vector Inner Product}

In physics, analytical geometry, and engineering, the
\textbf{dot product} has a geometric interpretation
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma = x \cdot y\ \ \ \Longleftrightarrow\ \ \
    \sigma = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_i y_i}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    x\cdot y = \|x\|_{2}\, \|y\|_{2} \cos\theta
\end{equation*}

% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vector Inner Product}

The inner product of $x$ and $y$ \emph{requires} that
$x$ be a row vector
$y$ be a column vector
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}x_1\ \ x_2\ \ x_3\ \ x_4\end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}y_1\\  y_2\\  y_3\\  y_4\end{bmatrix}
    = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 + x_4 y_4
\end{equation*}

% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vector Inner Product}

For two $n$-element \emph{column} vectors, $u$ and $v$, the inner product is
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma = u^T v\ \ \ \Longleftrightarrow\ \ \
    \sigma = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{u_i v_i}
\end{equation*}

The inner product is commutative so that\newline
(for two column vectors)
\begin{equation*}
    u^T v = v^T u
\end{equation*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vector Norms}

Compare magnitude of scalars with the \emph{absolute value}
\begin{equation*}
    \bigl| \alpha \bigr|  >  \bigl| \beta \bigr|
\end{equation*}


Compare magnitude of vectors with \emph{norms}
\begin{equation*}
    \norm{x} > \norm{y}
\end{equation*}
There are several ways to compute $||x||$.  In other words
the size of two vectors can be compared with different norms.



% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vector Norms}

Consider two element vectors, which lie in a plane
\begin{center}
    \pgfimage[height=3cm]{./figs/2Dvectorsab}
    \qquad
    \pgfimage[height=3cm]{./figs/2Dvectorsac}
\end{center}
Use geometric lengths to represent the magnitudes of the vectors
\begin{equation*}
    \ell_a = \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{20},\qquad
    \ell_b = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20},\qquad
    \ell_c = \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{5}
\end{equation*}
%% \begin{align*}
%%     \ell_a &= \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{20}\\[6pt]
%%     \ell_b &= \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20}\\[6pt]
%%     \ell_c &= \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{5}
%% \end{align*}

We conclude that
\begin{equation*}
    \ell_a = \ell_b
    \quad
    \text{and}
    \quad
    \ell_a > \ell_c
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
    \norm{a} = \norm{b}
    \quad
    \text{and}
    \quad
    \norm{a} > \norm{c}
\end{equation*}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The $L_2$ Norm}

The notion of a geometric length for 2D or 3D vectors can be extended
vectors with arbitrary numbers of elements.

The result is called the \emph{Euclidian} or $L_2$ norm:
\begin{equation*}
    \|x\|_{2} = \bigl( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 \bigr)^{1/2}
                 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^2} \right)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}

The $L_2$ norm can also be expressed in terms of the inner product
\begin{equation*}
    \|x\|_{2} = \sqrt{x \cdot x} = \sqrt{x^T x}
\end{equation*}

% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{$p$-Norms}

For any positive integer $p$
\begin{equation*}
    \|x\|_{p} = \bigl( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \ldots + |x_n|^p \bigr)^{1/p}
\end{equation*}

The $L_1$ norm is sum of absolute values
\begin{equation*}
    \|x\|_{1} = |x_1| + |x_2| + \ldots + |x_n| = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{|x_i|}
\end{equation*}

The $L_\infty$ norm or \emph{max norm} is
\begin{equation*}
    \|x\|_{\infty} = \max \left(|x_1|, |x_2|, \ldots, |x_n| \right)
                      = \underset{i}{\max} \left( |x_i| \right)
\end{equation*}
Although $p$ can be any positive number, $p=1,2,\infty$ are most commonly used.

\frametitle{Application of Norms}

\textbf{Are two vectors (nearly) equal?}\par
Floating point comparison of two scalars with absolute value:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\bigl| \alpha - \beta  \bigr|}{\bigl| \alpha \bigr|} < \delta
\end{equation*}
where $\delta$ is a small tolerance.

Comparison of two vectors with norms:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\norm{y-z}}{\norm{z}} < \delta
\end{equation*}

% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Application of Norms}

Notice that
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\norm{y-z}}{\norm{z}} < \delta
\end{equation*}
is \textbf{not equivalent to}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\norm{y}-\norm{z}}{\norm{z}} < \delta.
\end{equation*}

This comparison is important in convergence tests for sequences
of vectors.

\textbf{Creating a Unit Vector}

Given $u=[u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m]^T$, the unit vector in the direction of $u$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{u} = \frac{u}{\|u\|_{2}}
\end{equation*}

\bigskip
Proof:
\begin{equation*}
    \|{\hat{u}}\|_{2} = {\biggl\|\frac{u}{\|u\|_{2}}\biggr\|}_2 = \frac{1}{\|u\|_{2}}\|u\|_{2} = 1
\end{equation*}

\bigskip
The following are \emph{not} unit vectors
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{u}{\|u\|_{1}}
    \qquad
    \frac{u}{\|u\|_{\infty}}
\end{equation*}



% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Orthogonal Vectors}

From geometric interpretation of the inner product
\begin{equation*}
    u\cdot v = \|u\|_{2}\,\|v\|_{2}\cos\theta
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \cos\theta = \frac{u\cdot v}{\|u\|_{2}\,\|v\|_{2}}
               = \frac{u^T v}{\|u\|_{2}\,\|v\|_{2}}
\end{equation*}

Two vectors are orthogonal when $\theta = \pi/2$ or $u\cdot v = 0$.

In other words
\begin{equation*}
    u^T v = 0
\end{equation*}
\emph{if and only if} $u$ and $v$ are \emph{orthogonal}.

% ----------------------
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Orthonormal Vectors}

\textbf{Orthonormal vectors} are \textbf{unit vectors} that are \emph{orthogonal}.

A \textbf{unit} vector has an $L_2$ norm of one.

The unit vector in the direction of $u$ is
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{u} = \frac{u}{\|u\|_{2}}
\end{equation*}

Since
\begin{equation*}
    \|u\|_{2} = \sqrt{u\cdot u}
\end{equation*}
it follows that $u\cdot u = 1$ if $u$ is a unit vector.

    \left[
        \negthickspace\begin{array}{r}4 \\ 0 \\  0\\ 0\end{array}\negthickspace

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Linear Independence}

Consider two linearly independent vectors, $u$ and $v$.

If a third vector, $w$, \emph{cannot} be expressed as a linear
combination of $u$ and $v$, then the set $\{u,v,w\}$ is
linearly independent.

In other words, if $\{u,v,w\}$ is linearly independent then
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha u + \beta v = \delta w
\end{equation*}
can be true \emph{only if} $\alpha = \beta = \delta = 0$.


More generally, if the only solution to
\begin{equation}    \label{eq:linDep}
    \alpha_1 v_{(1)} + \alpha_2 v_{(2)} + \cdots + \alpha_n v_{(n)} = 0
\end{equation}

$\{v_{(1)},v_{(2)},\ldots,v_{(n)}\}$

Conversely, if equation~\eqref{eq:linDep} is satisfied by at least
one nonzero $\alpha_i$, then the set of vectors is \textbf{linearly dependent}.

    \item   Since a basis set must be linearly independent, it also must have the

            unique contribution to spanning some other direction in the space.)

            of the \textbf{subspace} that these vectors span.

\frametitle{Diagonal Matrices}

Diagonal matrices have non-zero elements only on
the main diagonal.
\begin{equation*}
    C = \text{diag}\left( c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \right)
      = \begin{bmatrix}  c_1   &  0  & \cdots & 0 \\
                          0    & c_2 &        & 0 \\
                        \vdots &     & \ddots & \vdots \\
                          0    &  0  & \cdots & c_n
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The \textbf{diag} function is used to either create a
diagonal matrix from a vector, or and extract the diagonal entries of a
matrix.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
    >> x = [1 -5  2  6];
    >> A = diag(x)
    A =
         1     0     0     0
         0    -5     0     0
         0     0     2     0

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Diagonal Matrices}

The \textbf{diag} function can also be used to create a
matrix with elements only on a specified \emph{super}-diagonal
or \emph{sub}-diagonal.  Doing so requires using the
two-parameter form of \textbf{diag}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
>> diag([1 2 3],1)
ans =
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     2     0
     0     0     0     3
     0     0     0     0
>> diag([4 5 6],-1)
ans =
     0     0     0     0
     4     0     0     0
     0     5     0     0

\frametitle{Identity Matrices}

An identity matrix is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal.
\begin{equation*}
    I = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

An identity matrix is special because
\begin{equation*}
    AI = A
    \ \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \
    IA = A
\end{equation*}
for \emph{any} compatible matrix $A$.  This is like multiplying by
one in scalar arithmetic.


% ----------------------

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Identity Matrices}

Identity matrices can be created with the built-in \textbf{eye} function.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
>> I = eye(4)
I =
     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0     0     1
\end{lstlisting}

Sometimes $I_n$ is used to designate an identity matrix with $n$ rows
and $n$ columns.  For example,
\begin{equation*}
    I_4 = \begin{bmatrix}  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                           0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
                           0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                           0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Identity Matrices}

A non-square, \emph{identity-like} matrix can be created with the
two-parameter form of the \texttt{eye} function:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=matlab]
>> J = eye(3,5)
J =
     1     0     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0     0
     0     0     1     0     0

>> K = eye(4,2)
K =
     1     0
     0     1
     0     0
     0     0
\end{lstlisting}
\texttt{J} and \texttt{K} are \emph{not} identity matrices!
