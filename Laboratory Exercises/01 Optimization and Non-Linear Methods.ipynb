The first function <code>plot_newton_iters(f, fprime, n=200, extent=[-1,1,-1,1], cmap='hsv')</code> calculates and stores the number of iterations taken for convergence (or max_iter) for each point in a 2D array. The 2D array limits are given by <code>extent</code> - for example, when <code>extent = [-1,1,-1,1]</code> the corners of the plot are <code>(-i, -i), (1, -i), (1, i), (-1, i)</code>. There are <code>n</code> grid points in both the real and imaginary axes. The argument <code>cmap</code> specifies the color map to use - the suggested defaults are fine. Finally plot the image using <code>plt.imshow</code> - make sure the axis ticks are correctly scaled. Make a plot for the cube roots of 1.\n",

The second function <code>plot_newton_basins(f, fprime, n=200, extent=[-1,1,-1,1], cmap='jet')</code> has the same arguments, but this time the grid stores the identity of the root that the starting point converged to. Make a plot for the cube roots of 1 - since there are 3 roots, there should be only 3 colors in the plot."
